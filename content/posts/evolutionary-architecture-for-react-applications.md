## Why evolutionary?

## Three criteria for evolutionary systems

1. Incremental change
2. Fitness functions
3. Appropriate coupling

Keywords:
- Quantum size
- Domain-driven design
- Strangler pattern
- Feature toggles
- Ball of mud monolith vs. Layered monolith - the quantum is still the entire application.
- Conway's law

## Common application patterns

### Spaghetti monolith (most frontend apps)

### Layered monolith (some frontend apps)

### Microkernal (monorepo)

### More patterns: message broker, ESB SOA, microservices

### Microservices (microfrontends)

#### Principles of microservices

1. Modeled around the business domain
2. Hide implementation details
3. Culture of automation
4. Highly decentralized
5. Deployed independently
6. Isolate failure
7. Highly observable
