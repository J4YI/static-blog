_Welcome to my blogging mini-series, entitled "Industry UX Standards that Matter for Academia." Enthralling and creative, no? Over the next few weeks, I'll be highlighting a couple of seemingly obvious, yet critical, user interaction endpoints that academic, government, and non-profit projects often overlook. I'll do it by including industry examples and studies that demonstrate which strategies work on a large scale. _

It's no secret that academic, non-profit, and government projects don't have the luxury of millions to spend on user experience design alone, and many such organizations lack the resources to hire someone that specializes in UX altogether. However, poor UX leads to an unusuable or unpleasant product and, even worse, unhappy (or nonexistent) users. One clever solution for smaller outfits is to glean what knowledge you can from industry giants and do comparatively small-scale tests to refine your UX based on your specific user base. Here are a couple of simple strategies that academic projects can apply to do just that.


# On-boarding and Registration


When you don't work for an organization whose goal is to make a bunch of money, it's easy to neglect some of the aspects of user experience that are typically associated with "making paper". However, easy on-boarding (or, the process by which a casual browser becomes a registered user) isn't solely about "converting" or conning a bunch of unsuspecting professors or researchers into signing up to use your service —** it's about showing them that your service can really make their lives easier, starting with their very first interaction with your organization.**

Everyone hates forms. No one wakes up in the morning and says, "I love paperwork! I love forms! Being a bureaucrat has been my dream since childhood!" Imagine you're having this exchange from [_Brazil_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088846/), you're Sam Lowry and your end user is Harry Tuttle:

[caption id="attachment_99" align="alignright" width="168"][![](http://monicalent.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/56588.jpg)](http://monicalent.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/56588.jpg) Everyone hates paperwork — and no, your website is never going to be wonderful enough to make people forget that.[/caption]

Harry Tuttle: Bloody paperwork. Huh!
Sam Lowry: I suppose one has to expect a certain amount.
Harry Tuttle: Why? I came into this game for the action, the excitement. Go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they got the whole country sectioned off, **you can't make a move without a form.**

Yes, your end user is Robert Di Nero, and he is very disappointed that you promised him action and told him to fill out a form first. Here are a couple examples and suggestions for getting your user on board without coming across as a dystopian, totalitarian government paper pusher:



	
  1. **Reduce number of form fields:** There's [a direct correlation between number of form fields users had to fill out](http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/6746/Which-Types-of-Form-Fields-Lower-Landing-Page-Conversions.aspx) and conversion rate. Just remember that people hate typing, so don't make them do it more than necessary.

	
  2. Therefore, **don't ask for data you don't need** (especially, not up front): Do you need your end user's phone number? Do you need their city and state? Even if you don't make these fields required, **[just their appearance is enough to drive away prospective users](http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/6748/3-Form-Fields-That-Kill-Landing-Page-Conversion-Rates.aspx)**. It's easy to obsess over all the cool metrics you can collect, but your user base will be outright smaller if you scare them away with questions they may consider too personal.

	
  3. If you can, in any small way,** ditch the form in favor of gradual engagement.** The basic concept of gradual engagement is to not only show prospective users what your service can do, but let them start using it before or during account creation. **Create value before commitment.** [Twitter famously boosted their conversion rate by 35%](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1128) by using gradual engagement techniques. Check out [a fantastic summary of their engagement lessons](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1124) learned.

	
  4. **Find fun and engaging ways of collecting information.** Sometimes, simply the interaction with your website will entice users to give your project more information about themselves. One example is ["Mad Libs" style forms](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1007), which increased on website's conversion rate by 25-40% across the board.

	
  5. Last but not least: **perform appropriate validation with JavaScript ** It seems so trivial, because it's probably easy from a developer's perspective to display a cumulative list of errors on submission. But these [usability niceties heavily affect who will ever reach your "Submit" button](http://blog.rejoiner.com/2012/07/how-to-use-inline-validation-to-increase-conversion/) (which, by the way, should never say 'Submit' — don't make your users feel generic with your generic form, get spicy!).


Once you've revamped your sign up and on-boarding process, **don't forget to check analytics.** Test for bounce rate, how often people start the form/process and don't finish, which form fields cause users to fall into error states, etc. Starting with [merely five users can help you identify 80%+ of your usability issues](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/), in particular.

Lastly, although taking notes from the big industry players and broad UX studies is important, every organization has its own needs for data collection and reporting. The only way to create an onboarding experience that meets the needs of both your organization and your user base is by testing.

_Tune in soon (read: whenever I get around to it) for the next round of UX standards that matter (especially) for academic projects. Some topics I've got in mind include designing navigation, designing a project home page, and most useful metrics to track for usability testing. Next time I plan to pull out examples of non-profit websites and discuss how specific UX techniques can help them improve in these areas. Til next time!_
